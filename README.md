# FullStackOpen-Part3

This repository containes the source code for part 3, backend-web-development, special needs. I created this repo alone since I will need to use Render, or Fly.io, as a Node.js host. For that reason, I had to make this one in a special repo didecated for that reason! All in all, Part 3 is here.

# File Structure & Naming
This repo only contains the code for an app called **Phonebook** that I have been working on two parts earlier.
