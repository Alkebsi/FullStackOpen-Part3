# FullStackOpen-Part3

This repository containes the source code for part 3, backend-web-development, special needs. I created this repo alone since I will need to use Render, or Fly.io, as a Node.js host. For that reason, I had to make this one in a special repo didecated for that reason! All in all, Part 3 is here.

## File Structure & Naming
This repo only contains the code for an app called **Phonebook** that I have been working on two parts earlier. This part will have the additional backend added to the app. I am expexted to creat the backend entirely from zero using Express and Node.js. The resource should also be RESTful APIs as that is the web standard of these days.
